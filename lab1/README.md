# ML Lab 1 â€” Binary Classification (NTUA, Fall 2023)

## Summary

This project was developed as part of the Machine Learning laboratory course at NTUA. It focuses on solving a binary classification problem using multiple supervised learning algorithms. The objective was to explore model performance through systematic evaluation and visualization.

Key elements of the project include:

- Data preprocessing and feature analysis
- Implementation of Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree classifiers
- Hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of decision boundaries and error trends

The project demonstrates a complete workflow typical in applied machine learning, from raw data to model selection and result interpretation.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
